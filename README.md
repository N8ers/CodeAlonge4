Are you ready for some seizure inducing fun!? This Pat-a-Tap Clone is a part of Colt Steel's online course "The Web Developer Bootcamp". 
I've added a directions display that disapears after the game begins and some cool background color changes inspired by another clone!
This project uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Paper.js, and Howler.js - it also features event listeners.
